            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young 
            physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment 
            at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, 
            venturing far beyond the world of known physics.

            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic 
            particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
            discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A 
            potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could 
            have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a 
            repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the 
            speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
          </p>
          <p>
            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the 
            heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, 
            warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the 
            wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but 
            would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
          </p>
          <p>
            “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the 
            page and drew a double box around it.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported 
            that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his 
            hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the <a href="#">first 
            sliver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes at the South Pole, a team 
            of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian 
            Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of 
            space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the 
            signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was 
            roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second 
            old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, 
            proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though 
            many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
          </p>
          <p>
            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in 
            science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing 
            the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast 
            realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 
            14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of 
            galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose 
            extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our 
            own universe there might be an endless number of other universes 
            bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling 
            over.
          </p>
          <h2>‘As Big as It Gets’</h2>
          <p>
            In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces 
            operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle 
            accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. 
            Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of 
            gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of 
            general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe 
            expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as 
            it gets.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, 
            sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a 
            bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a 
            picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as 
            the surface of the sun.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as 
            Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, 
            reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for 
            Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The 
            Astrophysical Journal.

            Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of 
            inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly

                <strong>THE UNIVERSE</strong> is just under 14 billion years 
                old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can 
                observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years 
                across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe 
                has an even temperature.

                an even temperature.

                see a similar cup in every direction, you might want to look 
                for another explanation.

                enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place before 
                they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled 
                from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might 
                explain their even temperature.

              <p>
                <strong>INFLATION</strong> solves this problem. The theory 
                proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the 
                Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of 
                light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field 
                eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the 
                universe.

                <strong>FLUCTUATION</strong> Astronomers have now detected 
                evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized 
                light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy 
                left over from the early universe. These are gravitational 
                waves predicted by Einstein.

                <strong>EXPANSION</strong> Returning to our coffee, imagine a 
                single, central pot expanding faster than light and cooling 
                to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like 
                inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the 
                froth and foam of the original pot.

            Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only 
            one in 10 million.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had 
            not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
          </p>
          <p>
            “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have 
            been lucky.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ 
            worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a 
            leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select 
            few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts 
            Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping 
            that night in 1979), in his office last week.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as 
            scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he 
            tended his radio telescopes.

            Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described 
            the most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, 
            in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week 
            when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s 
            team, <a href="#">knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne</a> 
            to tell him the news.

            Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had 
            ordered anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was 
            a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I 
            simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. 
            Linde wrote in an email.
          </p>
          <p>
            Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he 
            was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way 
            of spoiling a vacation,” he said.
          </p>
          <p>
            By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that 
            inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded 
            with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think 
            that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest 
            discoveries in the history of science.”
          </p>
          <p>
            John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor 
            and head of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope, 
            pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are 
            beautiful and very convincing,” he said.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to 
            inflation that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause 
            of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his 
            model, but he expressed reservations about inflation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the 
            need for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier 
            estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the 
            European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions

            “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. 
            Krauss said.

            Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft 
            will report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other 
            teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops 
            and space.

          <h2>Spirals in the Sky</h2>
          <p>
            Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of 
            the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno 
            Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the 
            Nobel Prize.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these 
            waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a 
            series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South 
            Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. 
            The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie 
            Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of 
            Stanford.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on 
            the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, 
            wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.

              The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the 
              faint spiraling gravity patterns — the signature of a universe 
              being wrenched violently apart at its birth. <span>Steffen

            In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave 
            radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight 
            preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the 
            gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in 
            one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would 
            twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists 
            said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have 
            little arrows going in spirals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small 
            differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s 
            telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting 
            thermometer.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.
          </p>
          <p>
            The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they 
            spent a year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making 
            sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might 
            beat them to the breakthrough.
          </p>
          <h2>A Special Time</h2>
          <p>
            The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists 
            like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, 
            suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the 
            universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: 
            gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But 
            they have long suspected that those are simply different 
            manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in 
            its earliest, hottest moments.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall 
            from grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers 
            falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one 
            force after another splitting away.
          </p>
          <p>That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
          <p>
            Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the 
            temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which 
            point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified 
            state too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with 
            a mysterious latent energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as 
            a kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since 
            it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space 
            was created, the harder it pushed apart.
          </p>
          <p>
            What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at 
            least a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of 
            primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a 
            cosmic eye-blink.
          </p>
          <p>
            Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary 
            particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still 
            ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and 
            stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there 
            is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the 
            universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting 
            from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once 
            started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a 
            comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue 
            blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known 
            as the multiverse.
          </p>
          <p>
            So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do 
            not bother asking about going any deeper into the past.
          </p>
          <p>
            We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very 
            beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before it. 
            All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept 
            away, forever out of our view.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a 
            Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team, “you 
            wind up at inflation.”
